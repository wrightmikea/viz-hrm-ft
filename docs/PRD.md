# Product Requirements Document: HRM Training Visualization

## Executive Summary
An interactive, educational web application that visualizes how a Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) learns to solve simple tasks through fine-tuning. The visualization uses a toy "Key ‚Üí Door" problem to demonstrate hierarchical decision-making, making complex AI concepts accessible through animation and interactivity.

## Product Vision
Create an intuitive, visually engaging tool that helps users understand:
- How hierarchical models decompose problems into sub-goals
- The fine-tuning process and how models improve with training
- The advantages of hierarchical reasoning over flat approaches
- The relationship between high-level planning and low-level execution

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: AI/ML students and educators
- **Secondary**: Developers interested in understanding HRM concepts
- **Tertiary**: General audience curious about AI learning processes
