I want to create a visualization of fine-tuning a really small Hierarchical Reasoning Model.  The visualization should be animated and step through phases and steps with graphical depictions of what is going on.  I'd like to start super simple ELI5 with a very easy task to learn with a small number of training data iterations.  Something like tic-tac-toe but even simpler.    Can you think of a super simple problem/task to train on and identify the steps to be illustrated and animated?  Start with a plan.

Thought for 17s
Here’s a concrete, ELI5-friendly plan to visualize fine-tuning a tiny Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) on a task that’s even simpler than tic-tac-toe but still requires multi-step reasoning.

Restate the goal
Build an animated, step-by-step visualization that shows how a tiny two-level HRM (a “Planner” and a “Doer”) learns—via fine-tuning—to solve a toy problem with sub-goals. The viewer should come away understanding: “the top level picks a sub-goal; the bottom level executes simple actions; after a few examples the model improves.”

Pick a super-simple task (with real hierarchy)
Task: “Key → Door on a Line” (1D world)
World: 5 tiles in a row: [ _ _ _ _ _ ]

Entities: Start (agent), Key, Door (locked).

Actions: Left, Right, Pick, Open

Objective: Move to K, Pick it, move to D, Open it.

Why it’s perfect:

Simpler than tic-tac-toe (no opponent, small state).

Requires hierarchy: sub-goals = “Get Key” then “Go to Door & Open”.

Short episodes (≤ 10 steps) enable tiny datasets and fast fine-tuning.

Intuitive to animate with cute icons and progress bars.

High-level architecture (HRM)
Planner (Level-2): picks sub-goals like “GoTo(Key)”, “GoTo(Door)”, “OpenDoor”.

Doer (Level-1): converts the current sub-goal + local observation into primitive actions (Left/Right/Pick/Open).

Memory (tiny): a scratchpad token like “holding_key = true/false”.

Training: Start from a base model that only knows crude priors (e.g., move towards target) and fine-tune with a handful of labeled or preference-scored episodes.

Non-functional requirements
Clarity first: ELI5 narration and tooltips; minimal math on the first pass.

Deterministic replays: seedable demos so viewers can scrub back/forth identically.

Low friction: runs in a browser (no GPU required), smooth at 60fps on modest CPUs.

Pedagogical knobs: sliders for “dataset size”, “noise”, and “training steps”.

Modular: swappable task panels (so later you can plug in a slightly harder task).

What we’ll animate (phases & scenes)
Below is the storyboard that the animation will follow. Each scene has what to show, what moves, and what the viewer should learn.

Phase 0 — Meet the world (10–15s)
Visuals: A 1D track with five tiles; icons for S, K, D.

Animation: Pulse highlight around S, then pan to K and D.

Narration: “We live on a line. To open the door, first grab the key.”

Phase 1 — Meet the model (the hierarchy) (15–20s)
Visuals: Split panel:

Top: Planner node emits sub-goal cards (“GoTo K”, “GoTo D”, “OpenDoor”).

Bottom: Doer node emits primitive actions.

A tiny memory chip showing holding_key: false/true.

Animation: Sub-goal arrows flow from Planner → Doer; Doer emits action tokens.

Narration: “The Planner chooses a sub-goal; the Doer figures out the small steps.”

Phase 2 — Before fine-tuning (a clumsy rollout) (20–30s)
Visuals: Playback of an episode with mistakes (e.g., trying to open without key).

Animation: Action bubbles (Open) bounce off the door; a red ❌ appears.

Overlays: “Wrong order!”; loss bar rising; reward gauge low.

Narration: “Out of the box, it tries… but doesn’t know the correct order.”

Phase 3 — The tiny training set (5–20 examples) (20–30s)
Visuals: A stack of tiny trajectories (cards): state → sub-goal → actions → reward.

Animation: Cards deal into two buckets:

Planner targets (which sub-goal at each step).

Doer targets (what action to take under each sub-goal).

Narration: “We fine-tune with only a handful of examples.”

Phase 4 — Fine-tuning loop (3–5 cycles) (30–45s)
For each cycle:

Forward pass: Show Planner choosing sub-goals, Doer choosing actions on 1–2 sampled episodes.

Credit assignment:

If wrong sub-goal: Planner’s loss pulse (red).

If right sub-goal but wrong action: Doer’s loss pulse (orange).

Weight updates: Tiny springs compress on the relevant edge; bar charts nudge.

Narration: “We adjust the right level: Planner for ‘what goal’, Doer for ‘how’.”

Phase 5 — After fine-tuning (clean rollout) (15–20s)
Visuals: Run the same start state; show crisp sequence: Right → Pick → Right → Open.

Overlays: Green ticks; reward bar fills; memory flips to holding_key = true exactly once.

Narration: “Now it solves the task in the right order.”

Phase 6 — Generalization & ablations (optional, 20–40s)
Visuals: Randomize positions of K and D; show success.

Switches:

Turn off hierarchy → show more steps/errors.

Freeze Planner → Doer flails when sub-goal shifts.

Freeze Doer → Planner chooses right goals but actions fail.

Narration: “Hierarchy matters: the right level learns the right thing.”

Phase 7 — Summary dashboard (interactive)
Charts:

Planner accuracy vs steps (line chart).

Doer action accuracy (line chart).

Episode reward (sparklines).

Steps per success (bar).

Controls: dataset size slider, noise knob, speed control.

Data & training details (kept tiny, kid-friendly)
State: (agent_pos ∈ {0..4}, key_pos, door_pos, holding_key ∈ {0,1}).

Sub-goals (Planner outputs): GoTo(key), GoTo(door), OpenDoor.

Actions (Doer outputs): Left, Right, Pick, Open.

Losses:

Planner: cross-entropy vs target sub-goal chosen by a simple teacher or rule.

Doer: cross-entropy vs correct action under the active sub-goal.

Training set: 5–20 hand-crafted or rule-generated episodes, some with distractor mistakes for contrast.

Fine-tuning: 3–10 epochs, batch size 1–4; stop early to keep it “mini”.

Visual language (how to draw it)
World panel: 5 tiles as rounded squares; emojis or icons for S🧍, K🔑, D🚪.

Planner & Doer: Rounded boxes with animated “token” pills flowing along arrows.

Loss/credit: red/orange glows on the responsible module, with tiny update arrows.

Memory: small toggle chip that flips to “holding key” exactly when Pick succeeds.

Narration bubbles: tiny speech captions (“First: get the key!”).

Low-level design (front-end)
Tech stack:

React + Framer Motion (clean, easy timeline control) or Svelte + Motion (lighter).

SVG for crisp tiles, arrows, and token animations.

State machine via xstate (optional) to script phases and playback.

Core components:

<WorldTrack /> (renders tiles, entities, and agent movement).

<HierarchyPanel /> (Planner/Doer boxes, tokens, memory toggle).

<TrainingDeck /> (trajectory cards, buckets).

<MetricsPanel /> (charts with minimal D3 or a tiny canvas chart).

<Controls /> (play/pause, speed, dataset size, noise).

<Director /> (orchestrates scene phases; exposes a timeline API).

State model:

SceneState = { phase, step, speed, seed, datasetN, noise }

ModelState = { plannerWeights, doerWeights, holdingKey }

Episode = [{state, subgoal*, action*, reward}] (* denotes target)

Data flow:

Precompute tiny episodes (JSON).

Simulate inference deterministically with seeded RNG for “pre” vs “post” behavior.

Apply mock “updates” (small deltas) so viewers see improvement without heavy math.

Methodology and approach
Explain-then-show: Each phase introduces one idea and then shows it.

Minimal math first: Tooltips can expand to the real loss equations for advanced viewers.

Short, loopable scenes: Each scene ≤ 20–30 seconds; allow scrubbing to any scene.

A/B toggles: “With hierarchy” vs “flat” to make the point visceral.

Accessibility: Reduced-motion mode; high-contrast palette.

Pros / Cons, Risks, Alternatives
Pros

Very small state/action space → smooth, fast animations.

Genuine hierarchy (order matters) → clear didactic value.

Works with a few episodes → fine-tuning is visible, not a black box.

Cons / Risks

If too deterministic, it feels “scripted”; add light noise for realism.

Over-simplification can hide nuances of real HRL credit assignment.

Mitigations

Add generalization tests (randomized positions).

Show ablations (freeze Planner/Doer) to emphasize roles.

Alternatives

“Two-Cup Game”: pick the ball after a swap → hierarchy = “Track ball” then “Choose cup”.

“Sort-by-Rule”: pick the object with rule “if color=blue then pick triangle else pick circle”—two-step conditional reasoning.

“One-Step Maze”: 1D with a block; need to Push then Go (sub-goals: clear path → reach goal).

Implementation plan (incremental)
Static storyboard: render world + hierarchy panels; add captions.

Playback engine: deterministic runner for episodes; show pre-fine-tune mistakes.

Training deck: card animations into Planner/Doer buckets; pulse losses.

Update animation: small “weight nudge” bars + improved rollout.

Controls & metrics: sliders and tiny charts; scene scrubber.

Ablations & generalization: quick toggles; randomized starts.

Polish: narration tooltips; reduced-motion; export GIF of final run.

If this “Key → Door on a Line” task works for you, I can turn this into a skeleton React app (with Framer Motion timelines and the episode simulator) so you can run it locally and iterate—plus hooks to swap in the “Two-Cup” or “Sort-by-Rule” tasks later.
